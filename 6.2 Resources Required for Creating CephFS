Step 1 Create resource pools.
Create two replicated pools named data_cephfs and metadata_cephfs. data_cephfs is the
data pool of CephFS, and metadata_cephfs is the metadata pool of CephFS.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool create metadata_cephfs
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool create data_cephfs

Step 2 Format the resource pools.
Run the following command to format the created resource pools:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph fs new fs01 metadata_cephfs data_cephfs


Step 3 Deploy the MDS.
Deploy two MDSs in the Ceph cluster.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph orch apply mds fs01 --placement="2"

After the deployment is complete, check the MDS status. The details are as follows:

ceph orch ls

Step 4 Create a user.
Create user01 and grant it the read and write permissions on fs01.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph fs authorize fs01 client.user01 / rwps -o ceph.client.user01.keyring
Check whether the configuration is correct.
ceph
